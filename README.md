## Reaction Speed Game

This game was made for educational purposes to show students at the school where I teach an example of using web sockets. 

When a player first arrives on the page they are welcomed with some instructions. Once they have read these they can click start. There is a player counter in the bottom left hand corner which will update as players join the game. We need 4 players for the game to begin.
