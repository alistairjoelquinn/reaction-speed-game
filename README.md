## Reaction Speed Game

This game was made for educational purposes to show students at the school where I teach an example of using web sockets. 

When a player first arrives on the page they are welcomed with some instructions. Once they have read these they can click start. There is a player counter in the bottom left hand corner which will update in real time as players join the game. We need 4 players for the game to begin.

After a fourth player has joined, and following attempts to join the game will be met with this message.

After clicking start the user moves to the game screen. Here they can choose which color they wish to be by clicking on it.

Until the fourth player has joined the screen will continue to say you are waiting. The player counter will continue to update as players arrive.

When you choose a color you will be informed which color you chose with this message.

From that point on, your color will be outlined in yellow.

When another player has chosen a color it will no longer be possible to choose. You will be informed that a color was already chosen.

When every player has chosen a color, a score counter appears for each player and the game begins.

Now every player has to wait for the circle in the middle to turn red.

Once it has turned red, the first player to hit their square wins a point.
